My strength is my backgound in business-end and enterprise-end application, lots of experience with software projects, proficient in Object Oriented Programming. Weakness is that I have a very strong character, so people don't usually listen to me, can get too serious when it comes to project management, not good with Ruby On Rails, or any similar language: Python(zero knowledge), Perl, Shell Script etc.
