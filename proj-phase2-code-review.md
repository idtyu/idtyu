My own code:

Followed agile style coding, with all external CSS and js files, carefully chosen ID , class and name naming convention, added comments. 

Akshay's and Hall's code:

Nothing I need to change or refactor at the moment, they all followed the MVC framework, and did a good job in terms of seperation of duties, to achieve an optimal cohesion and coherence level. Just that they need to use more meaningful naming convetion, add more comments, and use constants for commonly used strings and variables

Shawn's code:

Still at a very inital stage of jquery scripts, no comments yet. However, once it is done, it does require some refactorization

Shiv and Stuad:

did not do much coding nor did they upload any codes, no comments yet

Ilan's code:

Pretty much followed my convention, and identical to my coding style.
